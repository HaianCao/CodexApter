# Security policy

CodexApter runs on your computer. Provider settings are stored in your user
profile, and API keys in a local `.env` file in plain text: protect that file
and never commit it. The setup page listens only on `127.0.0.1`, requires a
per-session token and rejects other origins. The local gateway is
[Protoverta](https://github.com/HaianCao/Protoverta), which binds to loopback
only and has its own [security policy](https://github.com/HaianCao/Protoverta/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## Supported versions
